# Sentiment Analysis Exercise - Scikit-learn

## Overview
This repository contains a **learning exercise** for sentiment analysis using Scikit-learn.  
The goal is to practice text preprocessing, vectorization, training classifiers, evaluating models, tuning hyperparameters, and saving/loading models with `pickle`.

---

## What You Will Learn
- Define custom classes for handling review data (`Review`) and sentiment labels (`Sentiment`).  
- Load and process JSON datasets.  
- Split data into training and testing sets (`train_test_split`).  
- Convert text to numerical features using **TF-IDF**.  
- Train multiple classifiers:
  - Linear SVM  
  - Decision Tree  
  - Naive Bayes  
  - Logistic Regression  
- Evaluate models using **accuracy** and **F1-score**.  
- Tune hyperparameters with `GridSearchCV`.  
- Save and load trained models using `pickle`.
